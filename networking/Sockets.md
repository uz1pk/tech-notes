# What is a socket

A software API or abstraction for some Layer 4 connection (TCP, UDP, etc.) that is managed by the operating system. Without sockets it would be up to the programmer to implement, IP packet creation, managing connections, assigning connections, managing headers, handling ACKs, sequencing and transmission which would cause a lot of friction, overhead and burden.

Thus a standard interface is provided that gives you a connection to send/receive data over and the details of layer 4 networking and below are all abstracted and handled by the OS without even having to worry about the underlying protocols being used.

# 5-tuple networking

Layer 3 makes sure a packet reaches the correct host, but the host still needs to know which process (or thread) the data belongs to. Thatâ€™s where Layer 4 protocols and the 5-tuple system come in.

**Ports** are just numbers that represent ownership of a connection. For example, if one process uses port 8080, no other process on the same host can use that port at the same time.

**5-tuple networking** is how the operating system keeps track of TCP/UDP connections.

A **socket** is simply the programming interface (API) that lets applications send and receive data using Layer 4 protocols. Behind the scenes, the OS maps each socket to a real network connection using the 5-tuple:

`(source IP, source port, destination IP, destination port, protocol)`
This tuple uniquely identifies a network session between a local process and a remote process, and the OS manages it automatically.
