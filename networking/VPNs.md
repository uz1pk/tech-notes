# What is a VPN

GPT has a great example for this:

A secure, logical communication channel built over a public or untrusted network that enables remote systems or networks to behave as if they are directly connected on the same private network.

VPN = abstraction, and depending on implementation, it can look like a “virtual cable” (Layer 2), a “virtual router” (Layer 3), or just a “secure transport channel” (Layer 4). A **VPN is not one protocol**, it’s a concept: _create a secure, logical connection over an insecure network_.
